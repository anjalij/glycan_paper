RELEVANT STRUCTURES:

I think what I did here was search for structures that have the correct 
connections, and list them, but this does not seem like very many 
structures. In total it looks like there are 169 structures.



UNICARBSTRUCTDB
Column 1: The unicarb structure number
Column 2: Is it relevant for our work yes/no
Column 3: in a readable way what is the linkage, residues and anomeric 
            that are not relevant to our work?
Column 4: Stored as a residue the structure.
